// Lead-capture forms (Đăng Ký, Liên Hệ) submit straight to Web3Forms — a static-site-friendly
// relay that emails each submission to the inbox tied to your access key. No backend needed.
//
// Setup (one-time):
//   1. Go to https://web3forms.com, enter the inbox address you want submissions delivered
//      to, and copy the access key it gives you.
//   2. Paste it below.
//   3. Once this is non-empty, js/main.js sends real submissions instead of just logging them
//      to the console.
//
// Swap this out later for your own CRM ingest endpoint if/when it's deployed — js/main.js
// only needs WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY to stay wired the same way, or can be pointed at a fresh
// LEAD_WEBHOOK_URL if the payload shape ever needs to change.
const WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY = "578b134e-52a1-4095-9266-94ba57feba1a";
